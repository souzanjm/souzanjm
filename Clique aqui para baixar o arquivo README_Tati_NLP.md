# 💬 NLP Project Template — by Tati 🌸

Welcome to my Natural Language Processing project! This repository contains code and resources for building and training models that understand human language. It's all part of my journey as a TADS student specializing in AI and NLP.

---

## ✨ Project Overview
This project is focused on [📌 *insert project type here*: e.g. Sentiment Analysis / Text Summarization / FAQ Bot].

It uses Python and popular NLP libraries to:
- Preprocess and clean text data
- Explore datasets (visuals included!)
- Build and evaluate an NLP model (TF-IDF, BERT, etc.)
- Present insights or predictions

---

## 🧠 Technologies & Tools
- Python 3.11 🐍
- Jupyter / VS Code 📓
- Libraries: `nltk`, `scikit-learn`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `transformers`, `huggingface datasets`, etc.
